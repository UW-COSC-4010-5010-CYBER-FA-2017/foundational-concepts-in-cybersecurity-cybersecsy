## Least Privilege
The concept of least privelage is that you give each user the least amount of 
access to shared data as possible. Ignoring this and giving any Joe-Shmoe the 
keys to the '69 Vista Cruiser can result in everyone suffering from one 
person's mistakes. 

This can be facilitated both by limiting the user as well as limiting access to 
the data. Ideally, you want employ some combination of both. It's like a company 
that has a tier-system for their employees and what they are allowed to access 
as well as having a password to the door at the end of that dark 
hallway on the sixth floor that only some people with level 4 access know.
