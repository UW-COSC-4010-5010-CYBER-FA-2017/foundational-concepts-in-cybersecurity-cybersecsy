Example 4 driver.cpp exemplifies minimization because it is a small targeted piece of code. A class is used, which helps prevent the inner data from being accessed. Only the parts of the disjoint set that are meant to be accessed are allowed to be accessed. The functions provide for accessing the data in such a way that data integrity is maintained. Because access is limited, the target area for an exploit in the code is minimized.
