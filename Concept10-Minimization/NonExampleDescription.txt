Nonexample 4, driverbad.cpp does not exemplify minimization. Since a struct is used, much more information than is necessary is available. Instead of providing the minimum information to get a job done, the file is cluttered and shows everything about the program. There is no gurantee of maintaining accurate data because the data members can be modified at any time from outside code. The implementation of the disjoint set also does not allow for more than 1 to be created at a time because the functions modify a single global variable. The program cannot be easily expanded upon and has many vectors for exploitation.
