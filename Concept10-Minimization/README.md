## Minimization
Minimization is the concept of keeping the code small. This in turn minimizes the 
risk for security issues. Take for example a house and a mansion. It is much 
easier to lock all of the doors and windows in a house than it is to attempt to 
do the same for a mansion. 

This is done in programs by separating out code into different files based on 
functionality. It is easier to ensure the security of small focused blocks of 
code than it is to ensure it for one monster program.
