nonExample 4 driverBad.cpp does not exemplify abstraction because it is not a template class. It is bound to integers. This has very little flexibility and a very specific use case.  Also, the functions are right there next to main. None of the information about the implementation is hidden. A struct is also used, which provides no protection for the data members of the disjointSet. This makes data consistency impossible to guarantee. At any time, data members can be changed by the client. This also does not provide a controlled environment and allows for exploits.
