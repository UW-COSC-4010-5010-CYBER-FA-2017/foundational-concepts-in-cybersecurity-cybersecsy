Example 4 driver.cpp exemplifies abstraction mainly because it is a template class and a uses private data members. Since it is templated, any data type can be used with the class. This helps sepereate the design from the implementation. The client doesn't need to know how various functions are implemented, Only the behavior of the functions is necessary for a programmer to use the DisjointSet data structure. Since the data members are private, they are "hidden" from the client, in that they can't be accesses except in a controlled manner.
