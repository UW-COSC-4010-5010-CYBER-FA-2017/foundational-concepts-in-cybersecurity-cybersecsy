## Abstraction
Abstraction is a way of representing a problem in a way that helps us solve it. 
In terms of security, it is modeling a problem in such a way that necessary 
data is available for solving that problem and extra information isn't included. 
This is because that extra information is more grounds for an attacker to work 
with and therefore presents a security issue.

This is usually accomplished by keeping the program focused on it's main 
directive. The idea is to keep only currently relevant information around such 
that the focus stays on the program's task.
