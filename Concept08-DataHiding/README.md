## Data Hiding
Data hiding is the idea that you should keep sensitive information hidden so it 
can't be used in an attack. You don't want to impede on the functionality of 
your program, but you don't want to give too much away either. Rather, you want 
to maintain a balance based off of what the program absolutely needs to 
know. Also, it is just as important to hide your sensitive information as it is 
to hide the information that leads to it. 

This is done mainly by keeping your data in a separate place from the meat and 
potatoes of your program. This is sometimes easier said than done if you don't 
know the exact purpose of your program.
