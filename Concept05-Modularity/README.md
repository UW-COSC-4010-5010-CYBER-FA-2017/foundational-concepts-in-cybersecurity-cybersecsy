## Modularity 
This concept is all about allowing for mixing and matching of parts. Take for 
example your cell phone or anything made by Apple. When those products break, 
you have to relace the whole thing, even if it is just one component that has 
malfunctioned. 

To have modular code means being able to mix and match different files or 
functions as well as larger programs with other files, functions, and programs. 
With this functionality, you can quickly improve software and recover from an 
attack by switchinig out the broken parts of code for newer segments without the 
same security flaws.
