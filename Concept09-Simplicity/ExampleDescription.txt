Example 4 driver.cpp exemplifies simplicity in that it has a very targeted job, to implement a disjoint set data structure. There are only a few methods that each accomplish a specific task that is described in the .hpp file. The class uses private data members which helps keep the data members in good condition. The few functions provide all the functionality of the disjoint set class and keep the program simple.
