## Simplicity
Simplicity is all about designing software to be simple and focused rather than 
making huge complicated programs that are hard to work with. This ensures 
reliability of your program and makes it harder for an attacker to gain access. 

This is accomplished by keeping a level head while programming. Adding code is 
usually not the correct way to solve an issue with your program. It is better 
to have short, well-functioning programs without errors and warnings than one 
giant program that you muddled together at midnight the night before.
