This also exemplifies data hiding since the .h and .cpp files are seperated. As mentioned before implementation details are hidden, or can be. The programmer does not know, how all this is accomplished. You can see that a map is used to implement the data structure, but you cannot access it. There is no way to know what is done with the map or what map operations are utilized. All this is hidden because it is unnecessary for the data structure to be used in a program.
