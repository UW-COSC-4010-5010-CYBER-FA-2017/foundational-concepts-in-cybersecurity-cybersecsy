threads - non example of process isolation
forking - example fo proccess isolation
struct or just global vars - non example of encapsulation
class - example of encapsulation
sepearte .h and class files - example of modularity

scheduler - example of process isolation, modularity and encapsulation
threaded calc - non example fo those three


Exemplar:
 making example2 will create 3 executables, commander, processManager, and reporter. In order to run this program, you only need to execute the commander. There is an input file to do so. The basic idea of this application is to emulate a process scheduling algorithm. The input and output are really unimportant. The important thing is the way the three processes interact.
