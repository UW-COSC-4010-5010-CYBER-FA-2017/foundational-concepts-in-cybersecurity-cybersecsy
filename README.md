Big 10 Programming Assignment

Example1
Domain Separation and Least Privilege
-- Programs should be run with the minimum number of privileges and should be kept seperate from other programs. 

Example2
Process Isolation, Modularity and Resource Encapsulation
-- Processes shouldn't influence each other (ie share the same address space) and each should have separate resource allocations such that one breach isn't take all. This allows for processes to be used and replaced without disrupting the overall functionality. 

Example3
Layering and Data Hiding
-- You should hide your sensitive information and information that leads to it behind multiple different types of security measures. 

Example4
Abstraction, Simplicity, and Minimization 
-- Programs should be well designed, effecient, and compact operations that do one task and do it well with minimal information being requested.
