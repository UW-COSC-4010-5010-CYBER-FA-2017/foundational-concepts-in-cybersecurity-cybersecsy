## Global Makefile
You can compile all of the files and make all of the executables at once by running "make" in the main directory. Likewise, you can "make clean" to get rid of all of extra stuff. You can also make the examples one at a time. Commands for how to make and run each example program are given in the ReadMe's in the example directories. 

## Example1
#### Process Isolation, Modularity and Resource Encapsulation
Processes shouldn't influence each other (ie share the same address space) and each should have separate resource allocations such that one breach isn't take all. This allows for processes to be used and replaced without disrupting the overall functionality. 

## Example2
#### Layering, Data Hiding, Domain Separation and Least Privilege
You should hide your sensitive information and information that leads to it behind multiple different types of security measures. Programs should be run with the minimum number of privileges and should be kept seperate from other programs. 

## Example3
#### Abstraction, Simplicity, and Minimization 
Programs should be well designed, effecient, and compact operations that do one task and do it well with minimal information being requested.
