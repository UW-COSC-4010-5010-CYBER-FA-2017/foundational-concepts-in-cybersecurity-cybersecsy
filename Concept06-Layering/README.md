## Layering
Layering is the concept of implementing multiple layers of computer security. 
These layers must all be different. You never see a castle with 4 draw-bridges. 
It doesn't make any sense, since anything that can get past one draw-bridge can 
surely get past more of them. 

One common example in computer security is having both a password system as well 
as proper privileges for different users on a machine. This allows for two 
different kinds of computer security protecting sensitive information.
